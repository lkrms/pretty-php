----

`pretty-php` is a code formatter for PHP in the tradition of [Black][] for
Python, [Prettier][] for JavaScript and [shfmt][] for shell scripts. It aims to
bring the benefits of fast, deterministic, minimally configurable, automated
code formatting tools to PHP development.

To that end, you can use `pretty-php` as a standalone tool, run it from your
[editor][], or pair it with a linter like [phpcbf][] or [php-cs-fixer][] and add
it to your CI workflows.

Or you could just give it a try and [let me know what you think][discuss]. ðŸ˜‰

## Requirements

- Linux, macOS or Windows
- PHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1 or 8.2 with the standard `tokenizer`, `mbstring` and `json`
  extensions enabled

## Features

Code is formatted for

1. readability,
2. consistency, and
3. small diffs

and with a few [pragmatic exceptions][]:

- previous formatting is ignored
- whitespace is changed, code is not
- output is the same no matter how input is formatted

Also:

- Entire files are formatted in place
- Configuration is optional
- Formatting options are deliberately limited, workflow options are not
- Uses PHP's tokenizer to parse input and validate output
- Checks formatted and original code for equivalence
- Supports code written for PHP versions up to 8.2 (when running on a PHP
  version that can parse it)
- Compliant with [PSR-12][] and [PER][] if `--psr12` is given (details
  [here](docs/PSR-12.md) and [here][PSR-12 issue])

## Installation

### PHP archive (PHAR)

You can [download] the latest version of `pretty-php` packaged as a PHP archive
and use it straightaway:

```shell
curl -Lo pretty-php.phar https://github.com/lkrms/pretty-php/releases/latest/download/pretty-php.phar
```

```shell
php pretty-php.phar --version
pretty-php v0.4.18-d62ba37b
```

The PHAR can be made executable for convenience:

```shell
chmod +x pretty-php.phar
```

```shell
./pretty-php.phar --version
pretty-php v0.4.18-d62ba37b
```

It can also be installed to a location on your `PATH`. For example:

```shell
mv pretty-php.phar /usr/local/bin/pretty-php
```

### Composer

You can also add `pretty-php` to your project using [Composer]:

```shell
composer require --dev lkrms/pretty-php
```

And run it like this:

```shell
./vendor/bin/pretty-php --version
pretty-php v0.4.18-d62ba37b
```

> Until `pretty-php` is stable, locking `lkrms/pretty-php` to a specific version
> is recommended for production workflows. For example:
>
> ```shell
> composer require --dev lkrms/pretty-php=0.4.18
> ```

## Editor integrations

- **pretty-php for Visual Studio Code** \
  Official VS Code extension \
  [Visual Studio Marketplace] | [Open VSX Registry] | [Repository][vscode]

## Pragmatism

`pretty-php` generally abides by its own rules ("previous formatting is ignored"
and "whitespace is changed, code is not"), but pragmatic exceptions are
occasionally made and added to the following list:

- **Newlines are preserved** \
  Line breaks adjacent to most operators, separators and brackets are copied
  from the input to the output. \
  *`-N/--ignore-newlines` disables this behaviour*

- **Strings are normalised** \
  Single-quoted strings are preferred unless the alternative is shorter or
  backslash escapes are required. \
  *`-S/--no-simplify-strings` disables this behaviour*

- **Alias/import statements are grouped and sorted alphabetically** \
  *`-M/--no-sort-imports` and `-m/--sort-imports-by` modify this behaviour*

- **Comments beside code are not moved to the next line**

- **Comments are trimmed and aligned**
