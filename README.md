# PrettyPHP

## The opinionated formatter for modern, expressive PHP

*PrettyPHP* is a code formatter inspired by *Black*, the [uncompromising Python
formatter][Black].

Like *Black*, *PrettyPHP* runs with sensible defaults and doesn't need to be
configured. It's also deterministic (with some [pragmatic exceptions]), so no
matter how the input is formatted, it produces the same output.

> *PrettyPHP*'s default output is unlikely to change significantly between now
> and version 1.0, but if you're already using it in production, locking
> `lkrms/pretty-php` to a specific version is recommended.

## Requirements

- Linux, macOS or Windows
- PHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1 or 8.2 with a CLI runtime and the following extensions:
  - `mbstring`
  - `json`
  - `tokenizer`

## Editor integrations

### Visual Studio Code

- **PrettyPHP for Visual Studio Code** â€” VS Code extension by the same author.

## FAQ

### How is *PrettyPHP* different to other formatters?

#### It's opinionated

- No configuration is required
- Formatting options are [deliberately limited][options]
- Readable code, small diffs, and fast batch processing are the main priorities

#### It's a formatter, not a fixer<sup>\*</sup>

- Previous formatting is ignored<sup>\*\*</sup>
- Whitespace is changed, code is not<sup>\*\*</sup>
- Entire files are formatted in place

<sup>\*</sup> No disrespect intended to excellent tools like [phpcbf] and
[php-cs-fixer], which *PrettyPHP* will never replace. It augments these tools in
much the same way as *Black* augments `pycodestyle`.

<sup>\*\*</sup> Some [pragmatic exceptions] are made.

#### It's CI-friendly

- Installs via `composer require --dev lkrms/pretty-php`
- Runs on Linux, macOS and Windows
- MIT-licensed

#### It's safe

- Written in PHP
- Uses PHP's tokenizer to parse input and validate output
- Checks formatted and original code for equivalence

#### It's (mostly) PSR-12 compliant

*PrettyPHP*'s compliance with the formatting-related requirements of [PSR-12] is
almost complete. Progress is tracked [here][PSR-12 issue].

### If it's opinionated, why are there so many options?

*PrettyPHP* currently has more formatting options than one might expect from an
"opinionated" formatter. There are several reasons for this:

- The project is in early development
- PHP formatting is complicated
- Attracting early adopters is important
- Most people would prefer to pass an option to the formatter than wait for a
  version that fixes their issue

Over time, as *PrettyPHP*'s default output improves and uptake increases,
formatting options deemed unnecessary will be removed.

## Pragmatism

In theory, *PrettyPHP* completely ignores previous formatting and doesn't change
anything that isn't whitespace.

In practice, strict adherence to these rules would make it difficult to work
with, so the following pragmatic exceptions have been made. Most of them can be
disabled for strictly deterministic behaviour.

### Newline placement is preserved

Unless suppressed by other rules, line breaks adjacent to most operators,
separators and brackets are copied from the input to the output.

> Use `-N, --ignore-newlines` to disable this behaviour.

### Scalar strings are normalised

Single-quoted strings are preferred unless one or more characters require a
backslash escape, or the double-quoted equivalent is shorter.

> Use `-S, --no-simplify-strings` to disable this behaviour.

### Alias/import statements are grouped and sorted alphabetically

> Use `-M, --no-sort-imports` to disable this behaviour.

### Comments beside code are never moved to the next line

It might seem obvious, but it wouldn't be possible if *PrettyPHP* completely
ignored previous formatting.

> This behaviour cannot be disabled.

### Comments are trimmed and aligned

> This behaviour cannot be disabled.
